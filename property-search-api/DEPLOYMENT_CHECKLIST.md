## Staging Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Staging Environment

```bash
# 1. Backup current deployment
cp src/server.ts src/server.backup.ts

# 2. Deploy enhanced server (choose one option)
# Option A: Use the complete enhanced server
cp src/server.enhanced.ts src/server.ts

# Option B: Manual integration (follow INTEGRATION_STEPS.md)

# 3. Install any missing dependencies
npm install

# 4. Run tests
npm test

# 5. Start the server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Deployment

#### Health Checks
```bash
# Basic health check
curl https://your-staging-domain.com/health

# Advanced health check
curl https://your-staging-domain.com/health/advanced

# Pool-specific health
curl https://your-staging-domain.com/health/pool

# Comprehensive health check
curl https://your-staging-domain.com/health/comprehensive
```

#### Functional Tests
```bash
# Test enhanced search
curl "https://your-staging-domain.com/api/properties/enhanced-search?q=apartment&location=London&limit=5"

# Test admin metrics
curl https://your-staging-domain.com/api/admin/metrics

# Test existing endpoints (ensure backward compatibility)
curl https://your-staging-domain.com/api/properties
```

#### Performance Tests
```bash
# Load test the enhanced search endpoint
# Use tools like Apache Bench, Artillery, or k6
ab -n 100 -c 10 "https://your-staging-domain.com/api/properties/enhanced-search?q=test"
```

### 3. Monitor Key Metrics

#### Database Pool Metrics
- **Pool Utilization**: Should be < 70% under normal load
- **Average Query Time**: Should be < 500ms for most queries
- **Connection Count**: Should scale appropriately with load
- **Error Rate**: Should be < 1%

#### Search Performance
- **Response Time**: Should improve by 20-40% with intelligent routing
- **Success Rate**: Should maintain > 99% even under load
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Should increase over time as cache warms up

#### System Health
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks
- **CPU Usage**: Should remain stable
- **Error Logs**: Watch for any new error patterns

## Monitoring and Alerting Setup

### Key Metrics to Monitor

#### Database Pool Health
```javascript
// Example alert thresholds
{
  "pool_utilization_high": {
    "threshold": 85,
    "duration": "5m",
    "severity": "warning"
  },
  "pool_utilization_critical": {
    "threshold": 95,
    "duration": "2m", 
    "severity": "critical"
  },
  "average_query_time_high": {
    "threshold": 1000,
    "duration": "5m",
    "severity": "warning"
  },
  "connection_errors": {
    "threshold": 5,
    "duration": "1m",
    "severity": "critical"
  }
}
```

#### Search Performance
```javascript
{
  "search_response_time_high": {
    "threshold": 2000,
    "duration": "5m",
    "severity": "warning"
  },
  "search_error_rate_high": {
    "threshold": 5,
    "duration": "2m",
    "severity": "critical"
  },
  "search_fallback_rate_high": {
    "threshold": 20,
    "duration": "10m",
    "severity": "warning"
  }
}
```

### Health Check Endpoints for Monitoring

#### Kubernetes/Docker Health Checks
```yaml
# Example Kubernetes health check
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/advanced
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health/comprehensive
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

#### Load Balancer Health Checks
```nginx
# Example Nginx upstream health check
upstream property_api {
    server api1.example.com:8000;
    server api2.example.com:8000;
    
    # Health check configuration
    health_check uri=/health/advanced;
}
```

### Dashboard Configuration

#### Grafana Dashboard Queries
```sql
-- Pool utilization over time
SELECT 
    time,
    pool_utilization,
    active_connections,
    idle_connections
FROM metrics 
WHERE time > now() - 1h

-- Search performance metrics
SELECT
    time,
    avg(response_time) as avg_response_time,
    count(*) as request_count,
    search_type
FROM search_metrics
WHERE time > now() - 1h
GROUP BY time, search_type
```

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Pool Health Score**: Composite score based on utilization, query time, and error rate
2. **Search Performance Index**: Response time vs. success rate
3. **Auto-scaling Efficiency**: How well scaling matches demand
4. **User Experience Score**: End-to-end response time and success rate

---

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures for > 5 minutes
- Error rate > 10% for > 2 minutes
- Response time > 5000ms for > 3 minutes
- Pool utilization > 98% for > 1 minute

### Manual Rollback Steps
```bash
# 1. Restore previous server version
cp src/server.backup.ts src/server.ts

# 2. Restart the application
pm2 restart property-api
# or
docker restart property-api-container

# 3. Verify rollback successful
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# 4. Monitor for stability
# 5. Investigate and fix issues
# 6. Plan re-deployment
```

### Rollback Testing
